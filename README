# COSMOS

FIXME: write description

## Usage

lein run <version> <logtype> <logfolder>

<version> from ::cosmos-1
<logtype> from ::csv, ::pivot, ::push, ::ecj
<logfolder> folder name to be analysed from inside src/logs

csv files must have headers. There is no default ordering to the csvs. At a minimum, csvs must have the following columns
* *run* - a unique identifier for this run
* *generation* - the generation number
* *fitnesses* - the values obtained from the function used to order the individuals. 
The fitnesses are interpreted to be an array of values. If the data is pivoted so that each individual gets an entry, then use the identifier :pivot
